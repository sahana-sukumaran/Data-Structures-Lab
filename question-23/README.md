Problem statement:
There are n participants in a competition, participant i having a strength of s¿.
Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the other best participant. In other words, each participant i wants to know the difference between s; and s;, where j is the strongest participant in the competition, not counting i (a difference can be negative).
So, they ask you for your help! For each i (1 ≤ i ≤n) output the difference between s, and the maximum strength of any participant other than participanti.
