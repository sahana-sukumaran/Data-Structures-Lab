Problem statement:
Three guys play a game: first, each person writes down n distinct words of length 3. Then, they total up the number of points as follows:

if a word was written by one person that person gets 3 points,

if a word was written by two people - each of the two gets 1 point,

if a word was written by all-nobody gets any points..
In the end, how many points does each player have?
