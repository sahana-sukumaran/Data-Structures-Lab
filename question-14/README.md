Problem statement:
Write a C++ menu-driven program to implement infix to postfix and postfix evaluation. Use the singly linked list (SLL) to implement the stack ADT as a header file. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. The program has the following operations,
1. Get Infix
2. Convert Infix
3. Evaluate Postfix
4. Exit
The Get Infix option gets a valid infix expression and stores it efficiently.
The Convert Infix option converts the stored infix expression into a postfix expression. It prints the postfix expression at the end after conversion.
The Evaluate Postfix expression calculates and prints the output of the converted infix expression.
