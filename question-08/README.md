Problem statement:
Option 1 inserts a node so the list is always in ascending order. Option 2 takes two lists as Input, and merges two lists into a third list. The third list should also be in ascending order. Convert the file into a header file and include it in a C++ file. The second C++ consists of 3 lists and has the following operations,
1. Insert List1
2. Insert List2
3. Merge into List3 4. Display
5. Exit
The time complexity of operation 1 is O(n), operation 2 is O(m), and operation 3 should be done in O(n + m).
