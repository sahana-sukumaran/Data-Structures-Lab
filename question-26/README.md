Problem statement:

Polycarp was presented with some sequence of integers a of length n (1â‰¤a; n). A sequence can make Polycarp happy only if it consists of different numbers (i.e. distinct numbers).
In order to make his sequence like this, Polycarp is going to make some (possibly zero) number of moves.
In one move, he can:

remove the first (leftmost) element of the sequence.
For example, in one move, the sequence [3, 1, 4, 3] will produce the sequence [1, 4, 3], which consists of different numbers.
Determine the minimum number of moves he needs to make so that in the remaining sequence all elements are different. In other words, find the length of the smallest prefix of the given sequence a, after removing which all values in the sequence will be unique.
