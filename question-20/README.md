Program statement:
1.There are n block towers, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th tower consists of a, blocks.
In one move, you can move one block from tower & to tower j, but only if a; > a,. That move increases a; by 1 and decreases a; by 1. You can perform as many moves as you would like (possibly, zero).
What's the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower 1 after the moves?
